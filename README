Digest::Haval256
================

Haval is a variable-length, variable-round one-way hash function
designed by Yuliang Zheng, Josef Pieprzyk, and Jennifer Seberry.
The number of rounds can be 3, 4, or 5, while the hash length can be
128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits. Thus, there are a total of 15
different outputs. For better security, however, this module
implements the 5-round, 256-bit output.

BONUS

The C file, _haval.c, is a standalone Haval implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall _haval.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out
